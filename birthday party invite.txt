M's Birthday Party - July xxth, 10am-12:30pm

Hello!

We would like to invite Y to M's Birthday Party taking place on Sunday, July XX, 10:00am - 12:30pm at the JJNC.

Get ready to play! We’ll use our senses to discover what life is like for nature’s smallest creatures. We’ll peek inside a beehive, search for bugs and create a critter of our own to take home.

We have invited some of the Senior Preschool class and we ask that one parent from your family attends the entire party with your child. The Centre limits the number of people who can attend birthday parties so unfortunately we cannot extend this invite to siblings.

Please RSVP by Tuesday June 30 if you can attend and of any dietary restrictions or allergies.

We hope to see you July xx!

Thanks,
Gill and Tom
